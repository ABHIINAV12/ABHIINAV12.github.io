<h1>Hello World</h1>
<ul>
<li>we are all fools, some of us realize and some of us do not.
<li>how you do that stuff ? you lose your mind. you come to your senses.
<li>if you do not learn the easy lessons, they get harder.
<li>when destiny calls, you better answer the phone.
<li>you cannot wake up until you realize you are asleep.
<li>find out yourself, find that gateway beyond beliefs, beyond the mind, beyond the past and future, beyond the life and death and you will know.
<li>it is having your life count for something.
<li>you want special healing, you apply special discipline.
<li>keep it in your pants, just to see if you can.
<li>it is all a prespective of what you want the most.
<li>do not store past emotions as a tension.
<li>fear can paralyze, open the body, release the past.
<li>but you never know, so it is always good to stay calm and kind.
<li>it is not about becoming more spiritual, but rather more human.
<li>nobody's perfect, but if you forget your disciplines again, it is all over. Here you do not pass or fail. here you do or die. go home, decide and grow up before you show up.
<li>breathe into your belly, when you notice your thoughts or feelings coming up, just let them flow like a river, no need to cling to anything, just let it be.
<li>try to talk less, think less and feel more.
<li>nothing's left ? that is when you find out what you are made of.
<li>when something like this happens, all you can do is let it flow and let it go. life is not that easy but its all we got.
<li>one thing about dying, it sure gives you a sense of prespective. time to move on.
<li>have more attachment to people than things, till they are alive.
<li>you have got time, that is what you think. Not really.
<li>help others: truely understand yourself, know how to exert the right leverage, in right place in right time.
<li>if you get too serious about your purity and discipline, stress is going to kill you.
<li>you never really know for certain what is good luck or what is bad luck.
<li>everythings okay just as it is, let go of your mind.
<li>do not take your thoughts too seriously.
<li>practice everything, be right here, right now. Gateway is right here, right now.
<li>action is the heart of a warrior.
<li>look upward to the core of thought. feel the energy rising to the sky of mind. enter the space between waking and sleeping. between life and death.
<li>mind is a trickster wearning manny masks, gateway is guarded by the demon called fear.
<li>past and future are illusions, give no energy to them. (discover the real adversary and next time you will be better).
<li>life appears out of mystery. not controllable or predictable. stop taking yourself so seriously.
<li>life is not about success or failure, it is about testing our limits.
<li>death is perfectly safe, what is sad is that so few people live.
<li>whereever you step, path will appear.
<li>we do not control outcomes, only efforts, all we can do is show up and do our best.
<li>a lot of things are more important than winning a championship, there is a peice of world right here, right now, you have worked hard for it, so go get it.
<li>aim for excellence in the moment.
<li>resting in the moment you think of past.
<li>all this time, you just fight with yourself.
<li>pass through visionary gateway of deatb and birth, gaze up in heavens, see light at center of creation, beyond life, beyond death.
<li>find an understanding and peace greater than ever before.
<li>accept what the life offers, and for now, find solitude a peaceful companion.
<li>the journey continues without end, but now the path is filled with lightness and that makes all the difference.
